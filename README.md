## Installation and Execution Instructions
dwmstatus requires dwm window manager from suckless (https://dwm.suckless.org/) running on Linux to work.

From the cloned dwmstatus directory...

Run the `make` command to compile, then `./dwmstatus` to run the program.

`./dwmstatus &` to run the program in the background.
I suggest adding this command to your .xprofile to launch at startup.
